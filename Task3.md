## Task 3 - How did they get in? - (Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Research)

**Prompt 3:**

>Great work finding those files! Barry shares the files you extracted with the blue team who share it back to Aaliyah and her team. As a first step, she ran strings across all the files found and noticed a reference to a known DIB, “Guardian Armaments” She begins connecting some dots and wonders if there is a connection between the software and the hardware tokens. But what is it used for and is there a viable threat to Guardian Armaments (GA)?
