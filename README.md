# NSA-Codebreaker-2024

This is my writeup of the 2024 NSA Codebreaker Challenges

**Background:**

>Foreign adversaries have long strived to gain an advantage against the might of the United States Armed Forces. While matching the USA on the battlefield is a costly and risky proposition, our adversaries are always looking for ways to balance the playing field. A serious and real threat is the infiltration and sabotage of military operations before the fight even breaks out.
>
>Fortunately, the NSA is always recruiting bright young individuals to help protect our country! In fact, a bunch of your friends graduated last year and have been busy at work in their Developmental Programs.
>
>You have returned to NSA on your final Cooperative Education tour and are visiting your friend Aaliyah who is currently employed full-time in the Intelligence Analysis Development Program. Intelligence Analysts are always scouring through collected Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) for threat indicators. Aaliyah recently attended a briefing that highlighted Nation-State Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) targeting our Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractors.
