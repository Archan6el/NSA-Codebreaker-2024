This is my writeup of the 2024 NSA Codebreaker Challenges

## Task 0

**Prompt:**

As a participant in the Codebreaker Challenge, you are invited to join the New Mexico Tech Codebreaker Challenge Community of Practice!

Its purpose remains to give students interested in cybersecurity a place to talk about Codebreaker, cybersecurity, and other related topics.

To complete this task, first, join the Discord server. https://discord.gg/SWYCM5xr4N
