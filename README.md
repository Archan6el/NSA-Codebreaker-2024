Just join the CBC Discord and follow the steps ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Task 1

**Prompt 1:**

```
Aaliyah is showing you how Intelligence Analysts work. She pulls up a piece of intelligence she thought was interesting. It shows that APTs are interested in acquiring hardware tokens used for accessing DIB networks. Those are generally controlled items, how could the APT get a hold of one of those?

DoD sometimes sends copies of procurement records for controlled items to the NSA for analysis. Aaliyah pulls up the records but realizes it’s in a file format she’s not familiar with. Can you help her look for anything suspicious?

If DIB companies are being actively targeted by an adversary the NSA needs to know about it so they can help mitigate the threat.

Help Aaliyah determine the outlying activity in the dataset given


Downloads:

DoD procurement records (shipping.db)
Prompt:

Provide the order id associated with the order most likely to be fraudulent.
```

Okay so now we're actually getting into the actual challenges.
