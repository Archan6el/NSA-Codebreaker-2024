## Task 5 - The #153 - (Reverse Engineering, Cryptography)

**Prompt 5:**

>Great job finding out what the APT did with the LLM! GA was able to check their network logs and figure out which developer copy and pasted the malicious code; that developer works on a core library used in firmware for the U.S. Joint Cyber Tactical Vehicle (JCTV)! This is worse than we thought!
>
>You ask GA if they can share the firmware, but they must work with their legal teams to release copies of it (even to the NSA). While you wait, you look back at the data recovered from the raid. You discover an additional drive that you havenâ€™t yet examined, so you decide to go back and look to see if you can find anything interesting on it. Sure enough, you find an encrypted file system on it, maybe it contains something that will help!
>
>Unfortunately, you need to find a way to decrypt it. You remember that Emiko joined the Cryptanalysis Development Program (CADP) and might have some experience with this type of thing. When you reach out, he's immediately interested! He tells you that while the cryptography is usually solid, the implementation can often have flaws. Together you start hunting for something that will give you access to the filesystem.

## Solve:

Alright so for this task, we're given two zip files and one tar file. The tar file contains the image with the encrypted file system. `files.zip` contains interesting files from the user's directory, and `bins.zip` contains interesting files from the `bin/` directory. Well, let's unzip the `.zip` files and see what we get, shall we?

Unzipping `bins.zip` gives us two executable files. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed5891af-748f-45f7-9a44-d1bcbebe55e6)

Unzipping `files.zip` gives us a whole bunch of files, which are all strangely put into hidden directories for some reason. There are files that are put into a `.passwords` directory, `.purple` directory, and `.keys` directory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee19cee-cf96-40b2-a815-d4a09377d746)

First looking into these hidden directories, `.purple` seems to contain what seem to be chat messages between a user, `570RM` (presumably the owner of the drive) with multiple other users

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1871ceed-f0c3-4aae-a853-f7b7d30b44ff)

Each of these directories contain at least one file containing some chat messages. We'll take a look at these later

The `.passwords` directory contains exactly that, passwords for different services, but they're oddly all within a directory that looks to be a hash. Also, when we try to read any of the passwords, they seem to be encrypted, as seen below when trying to read the USB password

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d92cf91-306c-4905-908c-4c7b93fc1621)

The `.keys` directory contains also exactly what the directory name implies, keys. They seem to correspond to the same users that we saw in the `.purple` directory chat logs.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662742c1-789c-4c1f-9f4a-c8cf05c89259)

Interesting stuff here. We'll take note of all of this, and move to the two executables we found earlier.

If we run file on them, we see that they are ELF files, but if we try to execute them, they're clearly Python files

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d999e7c2-5864-426a-9036-255c98f0c6bb)

These seem to be Pyinstaller generated executable files. Thankfully, there's a tool that can easily help us with this, [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor). We just have to run `python3 pyinstxtractor.py <filename>`

Running `pyinstxtractor` on `pidgin_rsa_encryption` and `pm` gets us two directories, `pidgin_rsa_encryption_extracted` and `pm_extracted`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2edd082d-88de-4810-9f9c-a0f8f9f3ae73)

In each directory, we can see the `.pyc` file for each respective program, which contains the Python code for the executables! The only issue is that they're compiled. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bcc1c3b-63ab-4f41-aa7a-1a7e18737fb0)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5306b6ab-5b1c-4a74-abbb-10b8e379d2c9)

Thankfully, we have another tool for this, [PyLingual](https://pylingual.io/). This is a free tool that allows us to decompile `.pyc` files!

This gets us the following Python code for each file:

Taking a look at the `pm.py` file first, we can see that this is what's responsible for the `.passwords` directory. That weird hash directory indeed was a hash! The program stores passwords in a directory based on the md5 hash of the master password

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28400eea-a8f0-4ded-a157-dc4a2d16e20c)

Also, it seems to encrypt the passwords using AES CFB mode. It uses the master password to derive the key used for the AES encryption

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39e0a15-1985-47bc-a2ff-29abc5123b05)

This means that we also need said master password in order to decrypt any of the passwords

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c89598d-63f4-4b8b-b39c-3786aa35f8f7)

Since the master password is a md5 hash, `3ead1101919a08e7d7f345e92b1c66da`, I tried to crack it using rockyou, but no dice.

Without the master password, we kind of can't really do anything here. Let's now take a look at `pidgin_rsa_encryption.py`

Looking at the code, it's evident that `pidgin_rsa_encryption.py` is responsible for the `.purple` directory, which contained the chat message logs. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af1c0a02-5b7c-40a6-a7ec-fe35ebb36eee)

This program seems to use RSA to send encrypted messages and decrypt recieved messages via the pidgin chat platform

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ab01a91-1596-4398-a0a3-848309ad2390)

When sending a message, you use the public key of the recipient. When decrypting a received message, you use your own private key. This is just standard RSA.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a0cd1ec-d5bc-4725-9a8b-6d44fb6dbc87)

Also lastly, it seems that the messages once encrypted are converted to base64. Due to this, when decrypting, it expects the message in base64:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab760167-ecc5-4dcf-920e-fe5714623cec)

Well, since we know this program is used to send encrypted messages through pidgin, let's see if we can go through the chats and find any sent messages. 

First off, in a chat with a user named `B055MAN`, we see that `B055MAN` sends `570RM` the password for the USB using `pidgin_rsa_encryption.py`. `570RM` then seems to store it using `pm.py`. As we can see, the encrypted message is in base64. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0648896f-7dad-42c9-aa36-4318c7a5b90a)

This is likely the USB password that we saw earlier! However, there doesn't seem to be much we can do here. Let's see if there's anything more we can find.

In a message with `PL46U3`, we see that the AWS password the group was using was changed, so `570RM` needs to send it to `PL46U3` and the other group members

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c24aa596-08e9-4461-b89c-e29cbfafda13)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad72628-b872-420b-90bd-6f82539c0e3b)

We see that same AWS password is seemingly sent to user `4C1D` too

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc33f89b-91c8-4296-a532-6858c9a7d00f)

And finally, it is also sent to user `V3RM1N`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/546fc673-7b97-45bb-8cf2-228b2c68ea48)

Interesting. So we have the same exact message sent to 3 different people, and subsequently, with 3 different public keys. 

We have the following base64 encoded passwords:

Our main focus are those AWS passwords though. Due to the interesting set up, I start googling, and lo' and behold, I find something very promising. 

[Hastad's Broadcast Attack](https://docs.xanhacks.xyz/crypto/rsa/08-hastad-broadcast-attack/) is an attack that utilizes the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Essentially, if the same message is sent to at least 3 others, and their public keys all have the same small public exponent (ideally `e = 3`), we get a system of equations that we can solve with CRT. [This](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/blob/master/RSA-encryption/Attack-Hastad-Broadcast/README.md) also provides more info if you'd like to learn more. 

This is *exactly* what's going on here!

First of all, let's check to see if the public keys do indeed have a small public exponent

We can use [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool) for this. We just have to run `python3 python3 RsaCtfTool.py --publickey <PUBLIC-KEY> --dumpkey`

We have to check the public keys for `4C1D`, `PL46U3`, and `V3RM1N`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/092b5d96-69b1-4a95-b1a7-4c71b181b35f)

Look at that, they all have a public exponent of 3! This means that we can indeed use Hastad's Broadcast Attack to decrypt the AWS password. 

We can write a Python script to do this. Using the knowledge of the padding used from `pidgin_rsa_encryption.py`, the public keys, and the base64 encoded messages, we end up with the following script

Running this, we get the following result!

So the AWS password is `X?-d|C]jXN~Txh|Ew|`

Okay so we have the AWS password. How exactly does this help us get the USB password? 

Well, I underwent a lot of research. We seem to be done with the RSA part of this task, or in other words, done with the `pidgin_rsa_encryption.py` part. All signs point to the next part being related to the AES CFB part. I found some interesting stack exchange discussions [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21371/decryption-on-aes-when-the-same-key-and-iv-are-used) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4408839/been-advised-to-use-same-iv-in-aes-implementation?utm_source=chatgpt.com) all warning of using AES CFB and reusing the IV. This piqued my interest. Maybe this has to do with the intended solve? Time to test my hunch. 

If we look at `pm.py`, we can see that the first 16 bytes of each encrypted password actually is the IV

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e66a907-2cb8-4bbd-b47b-c54ada058e5d)

With this in mind, we can go through all the passwords that are stored in the `.passwords` directory just to see if any of them have matching IVs. 

We can write a Python script to do this

import os

# Path to the directory containing the encrypted password files
directory_path = '/home/archangel/nsa-codebreaker-2024/task5/.passwords/3ead1101919a08e7d7f345e92b1c66da/'

# Dictionary to store files with matching IVs
iv_dict = {}

# Loop through each file in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, filename)
    
    # Skip if it's not a file
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        continue

    # Read the encrypted data from the file
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        encrypted_data = file.read()

    # Extract the IV (first 16 bytes)
    iv_from_encrypted_data = encrypted_data[:16]

    # Check if the IV already exists in the dictionary
    iv_hex = iv_from_encrypted_data.hex()
    if iv_hex in iv_dict:
        iv_dict[iv_hex].append(filename)
    else:
        iv_dict[iv_hex] = [filename]

# Print files with matching IVs
for iv, files in iv_dict.items():
    if len(files) > 1:
        print(f"IV: {iv}")
        print("Files with matching IV:")
        for file in files:
            print(f"  - {file}")

Well would you look at that. The AWS password and USB password both have the same IV. This must be related to the intended solve!

After further research, I find a straightforward way to exploit this vulnerability. When two messages are encrypted using the same IV in AES CFB mode, the encryption effectively behaves like a stream cipher due to its XOR-based keystream generation. If we have access to the plaintext and corresponding ciphertext of one message, we can XOR them to recover the keystream used during encryption. Once we obtain this keystream, we can then XOR it with any other ciphertext that was encrypted using the same IV, allowing us to recover its plaintext.

Let's put this to the test shall we? Again, we can write a Python script to do this. We'll take the encrypted AWS password and it's known plaintext and XOR them together. This in theory should get us the keystream. We can then XOR the keystream and the encrypted USB password to get the plaintext USB password.

Did we do it? Is this the password?? I submit `*g55.^y$Te*XLWX-eG` as the password but apparently it's incorrect. What are we doing wrong?
