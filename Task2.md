## Task 2 - Driving Me Crazy - (Forensics, DevOps)

**Prompt 2:**

>Having contacted the NSA liaison at the FBI, you learn that a facility at this address is already on a FBI watchlist for suspected criminal activity.
>With this tip, the FBI acquires a warrant and raids the location.
>
>Inside they find the empty boxes of programmable OTP tokens, but the location appears to be abandoned. We're concerned about what this APT is up to! These >hardware tokens are used to secure networks used by Defense Industrial Base companies that produce critical military hardware.
>
>The FBI sends the NSA a cache of other equipment found at the site. It is quickly assigned to an NSA forensics team. Your friend Barry enrolled in the Intrusion >Analyst Skill Development Program and is touring with that team, so you message him to get the scoop. Barry tells you that a bunch of hard drives came back with >the equipment, but most appear to be securely wiped. He managed to find a drive containing what might be some backups that they forgot to destroy, though he >doesn't immediately recognize the data. Eager to help, you ask him to send you a zip containing a copy of the supposed backup files so that you can take a look at >it.
>
>If we could recover files from the drives, it might tell us what the APT is up to. Provide a list of unique SHA256 hashes of all files you were able to find from >the backups.
>
>Downloads:
